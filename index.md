# All the core Markdown Constructs

## Headings

Simply put a # (adding more # symbols will mean it's a subheading) at the start of a new line with the title of the heading.

## Styling text

**Bold** surround the text with either `**` or `__`

*Italic* with a `*` or `_`

~~Strikethrough~~ with `~~`

You can nest bolds and italics **for *example* like this**

***This is basically nesting but with everything in italics and bolded by surrounding it with `***`***

Subscripts<sub>like this one</sub> is done by putting the text between `<sub>` and `</sub>`

Superscripts<sup>like this one</sup> is similar to subscripts but with `<sup>` and `</sup>`

## Quoting text

Put a `>` at the start of a line to quote something

> like this

## Quoting code

It's everywhere in this section, surround the text with ` which is the key above tab.

Use ``` at the start of the line to put it in a code box

```
like this
and here's an extra line
and another one
```

## External Links

You can make text clickable which would direct you to whatever is put in the link [like this one to my github page](https://github.com/A4Fang) by using the format `[text](URL)` or you can leave it out like this: https://github.com/A4Fang

## [Section Links (this leads back to the top of this section)](#headings)

Similar to the format of an external link which follows: `[text](#[NAME OF SECTION])` of course on a text with the headings format

## Relative Links

[This is a link to the readme file](README.md). Same format as all the other links just with the directory to another file in the parenthesis. From the example `[This is a link to the readme file](README.md)`

## Images

The instructions told me to put pictures so this is a perfect spot while talking about the topics of links. Simply put an ! before the text.

I'll just put a drawing that I drew on my free time that I had at some point: ![meh](Images/AndyStyleLemon.jpg)

The instructions did say multiple pictures so here's an improvised drawing that I did: ![How did you know that I play genshin](Images/Lemon3.1.jpg)

The codeblock for the second image is `![How did you know that I play genshin](Images/Lemon3.1.jpg)`

## Ordered and Unordered List

- You can use `-` at the start of a line to put down one bullet point
* or `*` which does the same thing
+ or also `+` which would still create the bullet point

1. If you want an ordered list
2. use `1.`, `2.`, `3.` instead
3. What is the longest word you can spell with one hand?

## Task lists

- [x] put it in list format specifically with the hyphen `-`
- [x] Add brackets after the syntax of a bullet point
- [ ] leave a space inbetween the brackets for an unchecked box
- [x] put an `x` in it to check it
- [x] finished putting all markdown constructs in index.md
